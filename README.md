# Math with args and Python 

## Assignment for getting used to working with *args

In this assignment the objective was to become more familiar with *args. In **Python** we can pass a number of arguments to a function using this special symbol.
If we want to pass in varying different arguments and are unsure what arguments we may need, then *args is a great tool for the job. Just remeber that any arguments pass 
in to *args will be displayed as a tuple!!
